\# Guild Leagues - Game Design Vision



\*\*Core Concept:\*\* A roguelike guild management game where you draft characters with hidden potential, develop them through seasons of dungeons and combat, and compete against persistent rival guilds. Every character - fighter or staff - is discovered and developed by you.



\*\*Tagline:\*\* \*"Build your legend, one unknown hero at a time."\*



---



\## 🎯 Core Pillars



\### 1. Discovery \& Development (THE HEART)

\*\*Everything is about character attachment through discovery.\*\*



\- Characters start as mostly unknown quantities at draft

\- Through play, scouting, and time, you learn their true potential

\- Finding a "hidden gem" is the most rewarding moment in the game

\- Emergent stories: injuries, madness, death, betrayal, loyalty, triumph

\- Every playthrough creates unique narratives



\*\*Design Principle:\*\* \*Players should remember individual characters by name and feel emotionally invested in their journeys.\*



\### 2. Persistent World

\*\*Rival guilds are real opponents with real rosters.\*\*



\- 8 guilds total (you + 7 AI)

\- All guilds draft, sign contracts, lose players to retirement/injury/transfer

\- Characters can switch guilds when contracts expire

\- Rival guilds remember grudges, build reputations

\- The world continues between seasons



\*\*Design Principle:\*\* \*Beating the "Iron Hawks" should feel different than beating the "Shadow Wolves" because you know their roster and history.\*



\### 3. Meaningful Choices

\*\*Every decision has trade-offs and consequences.\*\*



\- Draft: Fighter or staff member? High risk/high reward or safe pick?

\- Contracts: Long-term security or short-term flexibility?

\- Season: Push for playoffs or develop young talent?

\- Injuries: Risk your star player or rest them?



\*\*Design Principle:\*\* \*No obviously correct answers. Every choice should make you think "but what if..."\*

\## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop



\### Phase 1: The Draft

\*\*Discover your team from unknowns.\*\*



\- Draft pool of ~20 prospects

\- Stats are HIDDEN based on scouting level

\- Must draft both fighters AND staff

\- Staff roles: Scout, Trainer, Medic, \[more TBD]

\- Rival guilds also draft (you see their picks)

\- Contract negotiations (length, salary)



\*\*Key Uncertainty:\*\* \*Is this person a future champion or a bust? A fighter or better as a scout?\*



\### Phase 2: Regular Season

\*\*Develop your roster through three activities.\*\*



\#### A. Dungeon Exploration

\- Procedurally generated dungeons

\- Combat + exploration + loot

\- Characters gain experience, reveal hidden stats

\- Risk of injury/death/madness



\#### B. Minor Guild Fights

\- Fight smaller non-playoff guilds for gold/rep

\- Lower stakes than playoffs

\- Good for testing/training young players



\#### C. Training

\- Focused development of specific stats

\- Safer than dungeons (less injury risk)

\- Efficiency boosted by Trainer staff

\- Reveals hidden potential over time



\*\*Strategic Choice:\*\* Balance risk (dungeons) vs safety (training) vs income (minor fights)



\### Phase 3: Playoffs

\*\*Prove yourself against rival guilds.\*\*



\- Single elimination tournament

\- Fight against persistent AI guild rosters

\- You KNOW their players (saw them draft, fought them before)

\- Championship = prestige + gold + better draft position

\- Loss = learn about your weaknesses



\*\*Emotional Stakes:\*\* \*Losing to a rival hurts more when you know their star player was YOUR 2nd round pick who you passed on.\*



\### Phase 4: Offseason

\*\*Roster churn and consequences.\*\*



\- Contracts expire → free agency

\- Players choose new guilds (based on loyalty, money, success)

\- Retirements (age, injuries, choice)

\- Retired players can become staff

\- Salary cap adjustments

\- Draft prep (scouting reports improve)



\*\*Persistence Payoff:\*\* \*That player you developed for 3 seasons just signed with your rival. You'll face them in playoffs.\*

\### Hidden Information System



\*\*Scouting Levels:\*\*

\- \*\*Level 0 (No Scout):\*\* "Unknown Prospect" - only see name, vague description

\- \*\*Level 1 (Basic Scout):\*\* See role, stat ranges (50-80)

\- \*\*Level 2 (Good Scout):\*\* See personality hints, narrower ranges (60-70)

\- Training → reveals growth potential

\- Season experience → reveals personality/loyalty

\- Injuries → reveals injury proneness

\- Stress situations → reveals mental fortitude



\*\*UI Challenge:\*\* \*How to show "partially known" information without being confusing?\*

\- Ideas: Stat bars with foggy sections? Confidence intervals? Letter grades that get more precise?



\### Character Progression



\*\*Growth:\*\*

\- Level up from experience (dungeons, fights, training)

\- Stats increase based on hidden potential

\- Some characters "bloom" late, some peak early

\- Training focus affects growth direction



\*\*Degradation:\*\*

\- Age: Peak performance ~seasons 3-7, decline after

\- Injuries: Permanent stat losses, can lose limbs

\- Madness: Prolonged dungeon exposure → mental breaks

\- Death: Permadeath in dungeons/combat



\*\*Retirement:\*\*

\- Forced (madness, catastrophic injury)

\- Can join staff (if qualified and interested)

\- Rival guilds can hire retired players as staff too



\### Relationships \& Loyalty

\- Retirement timing (loyal veterans play longer)



\*\*Emergent Stories:\*\*

\- Rivalry: "He killed my partner in that dungeon, I'll never work with him"

\- Loyalty: "I turned down more money to stay with you"  

\- Betrayal: "My star player just signed with my rival"

\- Redemption: "That bust I drafted? He's their MVP now"

\## 💼 Management Staff System



\### Core Concept

\*\*Staff are NOT hired from a menu - they're drafted/developed like fighters.\*\*



At draft, you must decide:

\- Is this person a fighter? Or future staff?

\- Can I afford to use a pick on a scout?

\- Should I draft a medic early or gamble on late rounds?



\### Staff Roles (Minimum for Alpha)



\#### Scout

\- \*\*Effect:\*\* Reveals hidden information about draft prospects

\- \*\*Levels:\*\* Better scouts = more/better info

\- \*\*Scales:\*\* Multiple scouts stack (slightly)

\- \*\*Contract:\*\* 2-4 seasons typical

\- \*\*Retired Fighter → Scout:\*\* Combat experience helps evaluate combat potential



\#### Trainer  

\- \*\*Effect:\*\* Increases stat gains from training activities

\- \*\*Levels:\*\* Better trainers = faster/more growth

\- \*\*Specialization:\*\* Might focus on specific stats (combat trainer vs exploration trainer)

\- \*\*Contract:\*\* 3-5 seasons typical

\- \*\*Retired Fighter → Trainer:\*\* Teaching what they know



\#### Medic

\- \*\*Effect:\*\* Reduces injury chance, speeds recovery, prevents deaths

\- \*\*Levels:\*\* Better medics = fewer/shorter injuries

\- \*\*Critical:\*\* Without a medic, injuries are much more severe

\- \*\*Contract:\*\* 2-4 seasons typical

\- \*\*Retired Fighter → Medic:\*\* Maybe they got injured and learned medicine?



\### Future Staff Roles (Post-Alpha)

\- \*\*Quartermaster:\*\* Better dungeon loot

\- \*\*Strategist:\*\* Improves playoff matchup preparation

\- \*\*Recruiter:\*\* Helps sign free agents

\- \*\*Sports Psychologist:\*\* Improves loyalty/morale

\- \*\*Strength Coach:\*\* Reduces injury risk specifically



\### Staff Mechanics



\*\*Drafting Staff:\*\*

\- Draft pool includes potential fighters AND potential staff

\- Hidden stats determine staff effectiveness

\- You must GUESS who will be good staff (or scout them heavily)

\- Trade-off: Use pick on staff vs fighter?



\*\*Development:\*\*

\- Staff have hidden potential too

\- Improve over time (experience)

\- Can be "busts" just like fighters



\*\*Contracts:\*\*

\- Same system as fighters (length + salary)

\- Compete with rival guilds for good staff

\- Losing your star scout to a rival HURTS



\*\*Retirement:\*\*

\- Staff can retire too

\- Fighters can become staff mid-career (injury forces it?) or after retirement

\## ⚔️ Combat System: Autobattle



\### Core Philosophy

\*\*"Management, not micromanagement."\*\*



Combat is about preparation (drafting, training, team composition) rather than tactical control. You watch your team fight, celebrate their victories, and learn from their defeats.



\### Visual Style

\- \*\*Top-down tactical view\*\* (~45° angle)

\- Real-time character movement around battlefield

\- Characters use stats to determine actions autonomously

\- Fast-paced but readable (~60 second average battles)



\### Battlefield Variety



\*\*Dungeon Battlefields:\*\*

\- Ancient ruins with crumbling walls

\- Cave systems with stalagmites

\- Narrow corridors and tight spaces

\- Rubble and environmental hazards

\- Dark, dangerous atmosphere



\*\*Minor Guild Fight Battlefields:\*\*

\- Training grounds

\- Town squares

\- Forest clearings

\- Mixed indoor/outdoor spaces

\- More "scrappy" feel



\*\*Playoff Match Battlefields:\*\*

\- Grand arenas with spectator stands

\- Open tournament fields

\- Professional, prestigious atmosphere

\- Larger, more open spaces

\- "Big stage" feeling



\### Combat Flow (Per Character)



\*\*1. Observe Phase\*\* (0.5-3.0 seconds based on observe\_skill)

\- Assess threats and opportunities

\- Check own health and ally health

\- Identify incoming attacks

\- Scan for priority targets

\- Time dependent on observe\_skill stat (200 skill = 0.5s, 1 skill = 3.0s)



\*\*2. Decide Phase\*\* (0.5-3.0 seconds based on decide\_skill)

\- Choose action based on observations

\- Factor in role, personality, situation

\- Consider cooldowns and resources

\- Time dependent on decide\_skill stat (200 skill = 0.5s, 1 skill = 3.0s)



\*\*3. Action Phase\*\* (0.5-2.0 seconds based on action type)

\- Execute chosen action

\- Attack: ~1.0s

\- Defend: ~0.5s

\- Heal: ~0.8s

\- Reposition: ~0.6s



\*\*Loop continues\*\* until battle ends (all enemies defeated or all allies defeated)



\### Player Control



\*\*During Battle:\*\*

\- ❌ No tactical control (pure autobattle)

\- ✅ Speed control: 1x, 2x, 4x

\- ✅ Pause button (examine situation, but can't issue commands)

\- ✅ Camera control (pan, zoom)



\*\*Pre-Battle:\*\*

\- Team composition selection

\- Formation/positioning (future feature)

\- Equipment loadout (future feature)



\*\*Post-Battle:\*\*

\- Replay key moment

\- Review stats and performance

\- Learn what worked/failed



\### Combat Moment Tracking System



\*\*The game tracks significant moments throughout battle:\*\*



\#### Moment Types \& Impact Scores:



\*\*1. Damage Spike (60-90 points)\*\*

\- 2+ characters deal 100+ combined damage in 3-second window

\- Coordinated attacks that eliminate key targets

\- Example: "Marcus and Sarah's devastating combo!"



\*\*2. Clutch Save (70-85 points)\*\*

\- Ally saved from death (healed when <10% HP)

\- Defensive action prevents lethal damage

\- Example: "Elena's heal saved Marcus at the last moment!"



\*\*3. Momentum Shift (65-80 points)\*\*

\- Comeback from numerical disadvantage

\- Killing enemy healer/damage dealer turns battle

\- Example: "The tide turned in your favor!"



\*\*4. Key Elimination (50-75 points)\*\*

\- Killing high-value target (healer, damage dealer, boss)

\- Elimination that cascades to victory

\- Example: "Destroying their healer doomed them!"



\*\*5. Close Call Survival (55-70 points)\*\*

\- Character survives with <5% HP

\- Near-death experience that leads to victory

\- Example: "Marcus survived with 8 HP!"



\*\*6. Perfect Execution (90 points)\*\*

\- Flawless victory (no casualties)

\- Dominant performance

\- Example: "Flawless Victory!"



\*\*Replay Playback:\*\*

\- Rewind to 2 seconds before key moment

\- Play 5-second window (2 sec before → 3 sec after)

\- \*\*Slow motion\*\* during critical action (0.5x speed)

\- \*\*Camera focus\*\* on involved characters

\- \*\*Text overlay\*\* describing what's happening

\- \*\*Freeze frame\*\* at moment of impact (1 second)

\- Resume normal speed



\*\*Alpha Scope:\*\*

\- 3-5 battlefield templates per type

\- Basic replay (simple rewind + slow-mo)

\- Track 1-2 moment types (damage spike, clutch save)



\*\*Beta Scope:\*\*

\- 8-10 battlefield templates per type

\- Cinematic replay (camera angles, freeze frames)

\- Track all 6 moment types

\- Smart selection algorithm



\*\*Post-Launch:\*\*

\- Procedurally generated battlefields

\- Save/share replays

\- "Season highlights" compilation

\- Player can save favorite moments



\### Stat Translation to Combat Behavior



\*\*Attack Stat:\*\*

\- Higher attack = more damage per hit

\- Affects target selection (confidence to attack tough enemies)



\*\*Defense Stat:\*\*

\- Higher defense = takes less damage

\- Affects positioning (tanks move forward, squishies stay back)



\*\*HP Stat:\*\*

\- Obvious: more health = survives longer

\- Affects risk-taking behavior



\*\*Speed/Initiative (future):\*\*

\- How quickly character moves around battlefield

\- Who acts first in simultaneous situations



\*\*Observe Skill:\*\*

\- How quickly character assesses situation

\- Better observers make better decisions (see more threats)



\*\*Decide Skill:\*\*

\- How quickly character commits to action

\- Better deciders choose optimal actions more consistently



\*\*Role-Specific Stats:\*\*

\- Navigation: Affects movement efficiency, positioning

\- Medicine: Affects healing amount and speed

\- \[More to be designed]



\### Design Goals



\*\*Why Autobattle?\*\*

1\. \*\*Fits the genre:\*\* This is a management game, not a tactics game

2\. \*\*Respect player time:\*\* Watching > micromanaging

3\. \*\*Emphasizes prep:\*\* Victory comes from drafting/training, not battle micro

4\. \*\*Creates narratives:\*\* Key moment replays generate memorable stories

5\. \*\*Scales well:\*\* Can simulate 100s of battles for AI guilds



\*\*What makes it engaging?\*\*

\- Speed control keeps it snappy

\- Key moment replays provide payoff

\- Visible stat differences create readable outcomes

\- Different battlefields keep it visually fresh

\- "Did my team comp work?" tension



\*\*Risk: Could it be boring?\*\*

\- Mitigation: 60-second battles (not 5 minutes)

\- Mitigation: Speed control (2x/4x if you want)

\- Mitigation: Replay system provides highlight

\- Mitigation: Preparation phase makes outcome feel earned

\- Mitigation: Visual variety (different maps, particle effects)



\## 🏆 Seasonal Structure



\*\*Season 1:\*\*

\- Total mystery draft

\- Everyone is unknown

\- High variance, high chaos

\- Building foundations



\*\*Seasons 2-3:\*\*

\- Better scouting (if you invested)

\- Some known quantities (returning players)

\- Rival rosters taking shape

\- Storylines emerging



\*\*Seasons 4+:\*\*

\- Established league "meta"

\- Known powerhouses and underdogs

\- Deep rivalries

\- Player legacies

\- Your early draft picks retiring/declining

\## 🎲 Emergent Storytelling



\### The Magic Moments We're Chasing



\*\*Discovery:\*\*

\- "That 6th round pick I almost cut? He's my best player now."

\- "I thought she was a fighter, but she's an AMAZING scout."



\*\*Tragedy:\*\*

\- "He lost his arm in a dungeon. Forced to retire. He's my trainer now."

\- "She went mad after that boss fight. Had to release her."

\- "He DIED saving the party. We retired his number."



\*\*Betrayal:\*\*

\- "I developed him for 3 seasons. He signed with my rival for 5 more gold."

\- "They stole my scout. Now they draft better than me."



\*\*Rivalry:\*\*

\- "The Iron Hawks beat me in finals 3 years in a row. This year is MINE."

\- "Their star player? I cut him in season 1. He remembers."



\*\*Redemption:\*\*

\- "That 'bust' I traded away? League MVP now. I was wrong."

\- "After the injury, everyone said cut him. I kept faith. He came back stronger."



\*\*Loyalty:\*\*

\- "She turned down double the money to stay. That's my captain."

\- "He's 37 and declining, but he's been with me since season 1. He retires a champion."

\## 🎨 Design Philosophy



\### Guiding Principles



1\. \*\*Unknown → Known is inherently satisfying\*\*

&nbsp;  - The draft gamble

&nbsp;  - The development arc  

&nbsp;  - The "I was right about him" validation



2\. \*\*Attachment comes from investment over time\*\*

&nbsp;  - Not just stats going up

&nbsp;  - Stories, near-deaths, clutch moments, growth

&nbsp;  - The longer you have someone, the more you care



3\. \*\*Loss must be possible for stakes to matter\*\*

&nbsp;  - Death, injury, madness, betrayal, free agency

&nbsp;  - But not SO punishing it's unfun

&nbsp;  - Balance: Tension without frustration



4\. \*\*Persistence creates meaning\*\*

&nbsp;  - Rivals matter because you remember them

&nbsp;  - Free agency matters because you lost someone

&nbsp;  - Drafting matters because you see consequences



5\. \*\*Systems interact to create emergence\*\*

&nbsp;  - Scouting + Loyalty + Injuries + Free Agency = Stories

&nbsp;  - Don't script narratives, create conditions for them



\### What This Game Is NOT



\- ❌ A pure dungeon crawler (management is half the game)

\- ❌ A pure sports manager (dungeons/combat is half the game)

\- ❌ A power fantasy (loss and failure are part of it)

\- ❌ A optimization puzzle (emotional attachment > perfect efficiency)

\- ❌ A story-driven RPG (emergent stories > scripted narrative)



\### What This Game IS



\- ✅ A character-focused management RPG

\- ✅ A generator of emergent stories

\- ✅ A gamble on unknown potential

\- ✅ A lesson in attachment and loss

\- ✅ A blend of strategic planning and tactical execution

---



\## 📐 Success Metrics



\*\*We'll know the game works when:\*\*



1\. \*\*Players remember character names\*\* without looking them up

2\. \*\*Players tell stories\*\* about their seasons unprompted

3\. \*\*Draft is tense\*\* (real decisions, not obvious picks)

4\. \*\*Loss feels meaningful\*\* not frustrating

5\. \*\*Replays feel different\*\* (different rosters, different stories)

6\. \*\*Rival guilds feel alive\*\* (not just stat blocks)



\*\*Red flags to watch for:\*\*



\- ❌ Players optimize all emotion out (treating characters as pure numbers)

\- ❌ Hidden information feels annoying vs intriguing

\- ❌ Contract management feels tedious vs strategic

\- ❌ Deaths feel cheap vs impactful

\- ❌ Seasons feel samey (no meaningful differences)



---



\*This is the dream. Now let's figure out how to build it.\*
